        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Harshal Patil, a passionate and innovative computer engineer with a strong background in software development and system architecture. I have a deep fascination for technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. My journey in the world of computers started at an early age, and I've been committed to learning and growing ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University(SPPU) to enhance my knowledge and skills. Throughout my academic and professional career, I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects, from web to mobile app development.
    </p>
    <p>
        My goal is to contribute to the ever-evolving tech industry by creating innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. I'm a firm believer in collaboration and open-source principles.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends, hiking in the great outdoors, or enjoying a good book. Feel free to connect with me and explore my portfolio to see some of the exciting projects I've worked on.
